Added the new parameter `unlockOnPress` for the key action `LockMods()`.

It enables e.g. to deactivate `CapsLock` *on press* rather than on release,
as in other platforms such as Windows.

It fixes a [12-year old issue](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/issues/312)
inherited from the X11 ecosystem, by extending the [XKB protocol key actions].

As it is incompatible with X11, this feature is available only using the keymap
text format v2.
