Added the new parameter `lockOnRelease` for the key action `LockGroup()`.

It enables to use e.g. the combination `Alt + Shift` *alone* to
switch layouts, while keeping the use of `Alt + Shift + other key`
(typically for keyboard shortcuts).

It fixes a [20-year old issue](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/issues/258)
inherited from the X11 ecosystem, by extending the [XKB protocol key actions].

As it is incompatible with X11, this feature is available only using the keymap
text format v2.
