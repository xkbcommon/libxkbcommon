Added deprecated keysym warnings:
- *name* deprecation (typo, historical alias), reporting the reference name;
- *keysym* deprecation (ambiguous meaning, all names deprecated).

These warnings are activated by setting the log verbosity to at least 2.

It is advised to fix these warnings, as the deprecated items may be removed in a
future release.
