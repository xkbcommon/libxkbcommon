Added options to configure the active layout when specific modifiers are active,
enabling controlling which layout is used with keyboard shortcuts.

Examples of use cases (they may overlap):
- Latin shortcuts for non-Latin layouts
- Qwerty/Qwertz/Azerty/etc. shortcuts for non-standard Latin layouts
- Shortcuts independent of the active layout in setups with multiple layouts

It works by specifying:
- A *modifier mask* to watch, typically `Control`, `Alt` and `Super`.
- A *mapping*: source layout → target shortcuts layout.

Then whenever the active modifiers contain *some* of the modifiers of the mask
defined hereinabove, the active layout is switched to the target layout defined
in the mapping, if any, otherwise it is left unchanged.

Added API:
- `xkb_state_machine_options::xkb_state_machine_options_shortcuts_update_mods()`
- `xkb_state_machine_options::xkb_state_machine_options_shortcuts_set_mapping()`
