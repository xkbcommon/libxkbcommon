Previously, setting *explicit actions* for a group in symbols files made the parser
skip compatibility interpretations for *all* the groups in the corresponding key,
resulting in possibly broken groups with *no* explicit actions or missing key fields.

Fixed by skipping interpretations only for groups with explicit actions when parsing
a keymap and setting relevant fields explicitly when serializing a keymap to a string.
