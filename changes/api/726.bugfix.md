Fixed included *default* section not resolving to an *exact* match in some
cases. It may occur if one creates a file name in a *user* XKB directory that
also exists in the XKB *system* directory.

Example: if one creates a custom variant `my_variant` in the file
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xkb/symbols/us`, then *before* libxkbcommon 1.9.0 every
statement loading the *default* map of the `us` file, `include "us"`, would
wrongly resolve including `us(my_variant)` from the *user* configuration
directory instead of `us(basic)` from the XKB *system* directory. Starting
from libxkbcommon 1.9.0, `include "us"` would correctly resolve to the system
file, unless `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xkb/symbols/us` contains an *explicit default*
section.
