/**
 * @page x11-overview Overview
 * @parblock
 *
 * The xkbcommon-x11 module provides a means for creating an xkb_keymap
 * corresponding to the currently active keymap on the X server.  To do
 * so, it queries the XKB X11 extension using the xcb-xkb library.  It
 * can be used as a replacement for Xlib's keyboard handling.
 *
 * Following is an example workflow using xkbcommon-x11.  A complete
 * example may be found in the tools/interactive-x11.c file in the
 * xkbcommon source repository.  On startup:
 *
 * 1. Connect to the X server using xcb_connect().
 * 2. Setup the XKB X11 extension.  You can do this either by using the
 *    xcb_xkb_use_extension() request directly, or by using the
 *    xkb_x11_setup_xkb_extension() helper function.
 *
 * The XKB extension supports using separate keymaps and states for
 * different keyboard devices.  The devices are identified by an integer
 * device ID and are managed by another X11 extension, XInput. The
 * original X11 protocol only had one keyboard device, called the "core
 * keyboard", which is still supported as a "virtual device".
 *
 * 3. We will use the core keyboard as an example.  To get its device ID,
 *    use either the xcb_xkb_get_device_info() request directly, or the
 *    xkb_x11_get_core_keyboard_device_id() helper function.
 * 4. Create an initial xkb_keymap for this device, using the
 *    xkb_x11_keymap_new_from_device() function.
 * 5. Create an initial xkb_state for this device, using the
 *    xkb_x11_state_new_from_device() function.
 *
 * @note At this point, you may consider setting various XKB controls and
 * XKB per-client flags.  For example, enabling detectable autorepeat: \n
 * https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/kbproto/xkbproto.html#Detectable_Autorepeat
 *
 * Next, you need to react to state changes (e.g. a modifier was pressed,
 * the layout was changed) and to keymap changes (e.g. a tool like xkbcomp,
 * setxkbmap or xmodmap was used):
 *
 * 6. Select to listen to at least the following XKB events:
 *    NewKeyboardNotify, MapNotify, StateNotify; using the
 *    xcb_xkb_select_events_aux() request.
 * 7. When NewKeyboardNotify or MapNotify are received, recreate the
 *    xkb_keymap and xkb_state as described above.
 * 8. When StateNotify is received, update the xkb_state accordingly
 *    using the xkb_state_update_mask() function.
 *
 * @note It is also possible to use the KeyPress/KeyRelease @p state
 * field to find the effective modifier and layout state, instead of
 * using XkbStateNotify: \n
 * https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/kbproto/xkbproto.html#Computing_A_State_Field_from_an_XKB_State
 * \n However, XkbStateNotify is more accurate.
 *
 * @note There is no need to call xkb_state_update_key(); the state is
 * already synchronized.
 *
 * Finally, when a key event is received, you can use ordinary xkbcommon
 * functions, like xkb_state_key_get_one_sym() and xkb_state_key_get_utf8(),
 * as you normally would.
