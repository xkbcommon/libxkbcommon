/*
 * The compose table data structure is a ternary search tree.
 *
 * Reference: https://www.drdobbs.com/database/ternary-search-trees/184410528
 * Visualization: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/TST.html
 *
 * Short example. Given these sequences:
 *
 *      <B> <C>        : "first"  dead_a
 *      <B> <D> <E>    : "second" dead_b
 *      <A> <F>        : "third"  dead_c
 *
 * the tree would look like:
 *
 *          -------- [<B>]---------
 *          |          |          #
 *          v          V
 *     -- [<A>] --   [<C>] --------
 *     #    |    #     |          |
 *          v          #     -- [<D>] --
 *     -- [<F>] --           #    |    #
 *     #    |    #                v
 *          #                -- [<E>] --
 *                           #    |    #
 *                                #
 *
 * where:
 * - [<X>] is a node for a sequence keysym <X>.
 * - right arrows are `hikid` pointers.
 * - left arrows are `lokid` pointers.
 * - down arrows are `eqkid` pointers.
 * - # is a nil pointer.
 *
 * The nodes are all kept in a contiguous array.  Pointers are represented
 * as integer offsets into this array.  A nil pointer is represented as 0
 * (which, helpfully, is the offset of an empty dummy node).
 *
 * Nodes without an eqkid are leaf nodes.  Since a sequence cannot be a
 * prefix of another, these are exactly the nodes which terminate the
 * sequences (in a bijective manner).
 *
 * A leaf contains the result data of its sequence.  The result keysym is
 * contained in the node struct itself; the result UTF-8 string is a byte
 * offset into an array of the form "\0first\0second\0third" (the initial
 * \0 is so offset 0 points to an empty string).
