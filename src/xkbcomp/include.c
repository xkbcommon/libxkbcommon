/**
 * Parse an include statement. Each call returns a file name, along with
 * (possibly) a specific map in the file, an explicit group designator, and
 * the separator from the next file, used to determine the merge mode.
 *
 * @param str_inout Input statement, modified in-place. Should be passed in
 * repeatedly. If str_inout is NULL, the parsing has completed.
 *
 * @param file_rtrn Set to the name of the include file to be used. Combined
 * with an enum xkb_file_type, this determines which file to look for in the
 * include path.
 *
 * @param map_rtrn Set to the string between '(' and ')', if any. This will
 * result in the compilation of a specific named map within the file (e.g.
 * xkb_symbols "basic" { ... }) , as opposed to the default map of the file.
 *
 * @param nextop_rtrn Set to the next operation in the complete statement,
 * which is '\0' if it's the last file or '+' or '|' if there are more.
 * Separating the files with '+' sets the merge mode to MERGE_MODE_OVERRIDE,
 * while '|' sets the merge mode to MERGE_MODE_AUGMENT.
 *
 * @param extra_data Set to the string after ':', if any. Currently the
 * extra data is only used for setting an explicit group index for a symbols
 * file.
 *
 * @return true if parsing was successful, false for an illegal string.
 *
 * Example: "evdev+aliases(qwerty):2"
 *      str_inout = "aliases(qwerty):2"
 *      file_rtrn = "evdev"
 *      map_rtrn = NULL
 *      nextop_retrn = "+"
 *      extra_data = NULL
 *
 * 2nd run with "aliases(qwerty):2"
 *      str_inout = NULL
 *      file_rtrn = "aliases"
 *      map_rtrn = "qwerty"
 *      nextop_retrn = ""
 *      extra_data = "2"
