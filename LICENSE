The following is a list of all copyright notices and license statements which
appear in the xkbcommon source tree, along with the SPDX short license
identifiers which source files use to refer to them. To see which parts are
covered by which license and copyright, refer to the source files.

If making new contributions, the MIT License is vastly preferred.

All licenses are derivative of the MIT/X11 license, mostly identical other
than no-endorsement clauses (e.g. paragraph 4 of The Open Group's license).

These statements are split into two sections: one for the code compiled and
distributed as part of the libxkbcommon shared library and the code component
of all tests, and another only for the test data under test/data, which is
distributed with the xkbcommon source code, but not installed to the system.
