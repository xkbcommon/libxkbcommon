# Guidelines:
# • A message code must always have the same meaning forever.
# • Codes may be retired or introduced in new releases. In order to avoid
#   clashes, retired codes must not be deleted.
# • Codes should not themselves reflect classification, e.g. a range for parse
#   errors and a range for each keymap component.
# • Codes should not be assigned sequentially because it is misleading.
# • Codes must be in the range 1..999. This range may be extended once every
#   code has be assigned.
#
# See the following guidelines for further details on good practices:
# https://github.com/haskellfoundation/error-message-index/blob/main/tool-developers.md#code-assignment-recommendations

# NOTE: Field “added: ALWAYS” means that the precise version is unknown and
# anterior to the introduction of the message registry. It will be replaced by
# the default version 1.0.0 in the generated documentation. While this is deemed
# good enough to avoid spelunking commit history, a more precise version would
# be welcome.

    You may find the list of supported keysyms in

    - name: Unrecognized keysym “`coma`”

        ```

        xkbcommon does not recognize the keysym “`coma`”. It is most probably
        a typo for “<code>com<em>m</em>a</code>”.
        See: `XKB_KEY_comma` in `include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-keysyms.h`.

- id: "missing-default-section"
  code: 433
  added: ALWAYS
  type: warning
  description: "Missing default section in included file"
  details: |
    When using an include statement, the included file may contains multiple sections.
    The include statement may specify the name of the section to include, or leave it
    unspecified. In the latter case, the included file must then define a *default* section.
    The present warning is shown when no default section is defined.

    To solve this, either fix the include statement by specifying the exact section to
    include, or declare a default section in the included file.
